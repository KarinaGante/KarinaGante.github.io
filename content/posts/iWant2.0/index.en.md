## iWant 2.0

<p align="justify">iWant 2.0 is an assistive communication tool designed specifically to support individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Developed as part of a university capstone project, the app was created using Thunkable, a block-based programming platform that enables the development of customized, interactive mobile applications to facilitate non-verbal communication and promote digital inclusion for autistic individuals. </p>

<p align="justify">This innovative assistive technology project was officially accepted, published, and presented at the 14th Innovation, Science and Technology Congress (CONICT). Additionally, iWant 2.0 was exposed at IFCIÃŠNCIA â€” the Science, Technology, and Entrepreneurship Fair held in Salto â€” further validating its relevance as a valuable initiative for accessibility and inclusive education.</p>

<p align="justify">iWant 2.0 combines inclusive design, technological innovation, and educational purpose to develop accessible digital tools tailored to the unique communication needs of people with autism. It stands as a powerful example of how technology can enhance quality of life, autonomy, and participation in both educational and social environments.</p>
