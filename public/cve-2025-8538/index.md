## CVE-2025-8538

### Introduction

<p align="justify">While I was analyzing the Open-Source project <a href="https://github.com/portabilis/i-educar" target=_blank>i-Educar</a>, I stumbled upon something unexpected: a stored XSS vulnerability that could silently affect anyone using the system. And it wasn‚Äôt just one field ‚Äî both the <b>name</b> and <b>description</b> parameters in the <b>/usuarios/tipos/novo</b> route were vulnerable. </br> After properly testing, documenting, and reporting the issue, it was officially assigned as <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8538" target=_blank>CVE-2025-8538</a>. </br> In this post, I‚Äôll show you how I found the flaw, how it works, and why it matters ‚Äî with real screenshots, a working PoC, and the impact this kind of bug can have in production environments. </p>

### What is CVE-2025-8538?

<p align="justify"><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-8538" target=_blank>CVE-2025-8538</a> indicates two stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the <b>/usuarios/tipos/novo</b> endpoint of the <a href="https://github.com/portabilis/i-educar" target=_blank>i-Educar</a> application. </br> The vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the <b>name</b> and <b>description</b> fields. </br> These scripts are saved on the server and executed as soon as the <b>/usuarios/tipos</b> page is loaded. This means that any user who accesses that page ends up executing the script without noticing. </p>

### Technical Details

‚û§ **Vulnerable Endpoint** `/usuarios/tipos/novo`

‚û§ **Affected Parameters:** `name`, `description`

‚û§ **Trigger Page:** `/usuarios/tipos`

> ‚û§ **Payload Used** 
> ```html
>"><img src=x onerror=alert('CVE-Hunters')>
>```

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

To demonstrate the vulnerability, the following steps were performed:

‚û§ **Access the endpoint:** `/usuarios/tipos/novo`

‚û§ **Insert the payload above into the fields:** `Tipo de Usu√°rio` e `Descri√ß√£o`

‚û§ **Click on:** ‚ÄúSalvar‚Äù

> The `/usuarios/tipos` page will automatically load, triggering the XSS:
