## TryHackMe: Desafio OSINT

### Full Walkthrough & Guide

<p align="justify">This is a complete walkthrough of the OSINT Challenge hosted on TryHackMe, a popular cybersecurity learning platform. This open-source intelligence (OSINT) room challenges users to trace a fictional characterâ€™s digital footprint, starting from a single image.</p>

<p align="justify">Throughout the challenge, participants will extract metadata, perform reverse image searches, investigate social media activity, and explore GitHub repositories to discover hidden flagsâ€”one of which is cleverly embedded in an interactive element on a personal blog. Perfect for cybersecurity beginners and digital investigators, this hands-on CTF (Capture The Flag) provides practical OSINT training using real-world techniques.</p>

<p align="justify">Whether you're preparing for a cybersecurity career, studying for OSINT certifications, or just love solving online puzzles, this room is a great way to boost your reconnaissance skills and learn how to track someone online using only publicly available data.</p>
