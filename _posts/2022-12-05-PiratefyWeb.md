# Piratefy

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Piratefy is a fully functional web-based music streaming platform inspired by Spotify, developed from scratch using core web technologies including HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, and a MySQL database. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The system is entirely deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS), utilizing services such as EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk for scalable cloud hosting, and Amazon RDS for robust and secure cloud-based database management.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Designed as an academic project, Piratefy replicates key features of modern music streaming platforms, emphasizing responsive design, intuitive user experience (UX), and seamless integration with cloud infrastructure. This project demonstrates real-world skills in full-stack development, cloud computing, and music tech innovation.
