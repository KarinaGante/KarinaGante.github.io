# Monthly Sales Report

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This interactive sales report was developed using Microsoft Power BI and powered by an Excel-based data source, with the goal of analyzing monthly sales trends across multiple years. By leveraging data visualization tools and advanced analytics features in Power BI, it became possible to identify seasonal sales patterns, uncovering insights into sales fluctuations throughout the year.
